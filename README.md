An iOS / Android App in React Native to help computer science students study important topics via 1v1 coding and trivia games. 

Currently, this repo consists of a non-functional layout of how the app would have looked. With enough research, we quickly realized that this market was already serviced by a number of apps and websites, and we also ran into a number of technical difficulties including: allowing users to run and execute code in an iOS environment; implementing robust cybersecurity in order to prevent malicious code from being run; real-time user gameplay. As such, we have tabled this project.
